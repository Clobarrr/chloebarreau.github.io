            <h1>SPEED TESTS WITH PYTHON</h1>
          <p>Learned the foundations of sending data over the Internet with HTTPs and APIs. Used Python because it was a new langauge, could be picked up quickly, and would be opimal for playing with data.</p>
          <h1>PURPOSE</h1>
          <p>Websites in China are often not optimized for the West and vice versa. The speed tests demonstrate the discrepancy. The startup I was working for, Notey, is creating a product that automatically converts Western resources to the Chinese equivalent (e.g. Google Maps to Baidu Maps, YouTube to YouKu etc)</p>
          <h1>CHALLENGES</h1>
          <p>Learned to dig into not just the program I was creating, but also the other resources I was leveraging. For a while I couldn't understand why I was reading incomplete JSON data and spent ages looking at more complicated solutions, such as polling, without extensively testing to understand the original problem. When I finally reverted, I realised I just needed to give the API more time (longer delay). This project taught me a couple of things 1) Yes, I was only two days into Python, but I should trust my instincts rather than rush to overcomplicate things. 2) Python is very easy to read, but lower level languages are more explicit and I was midly nostalgic when wanting to pass by reference.</p>

        <h1>WiCS INNOVATION FELLOWSHIP PROJECT</h1>
          <p>Collaberated with three Stanford students to create a social service website dedicated to the building of diverse project teams. Utilised HTML, CSS, Javascript and was kindly mentored by Capital One.</p>
          <h1>PURPOSE</h1>
          <p>This project stemmed from a desire to encourage students to work with others on their ambitious ideas. Enroute embraces networking with others of similar interests and different strengths.</p>
          <h1>TAKEAWAYS</h1>
          <p>Working in a team introduced me to the basics of github and the value of programming in a way that is clean and accessible to others. I also enjoyed tapping into new online resources for front-end development!</p>
